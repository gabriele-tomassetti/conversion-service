# A Simple Service to Convert Between Different Formats

This is the companion repository of the article [So Much Data, So Many Formats: a Conversion Service](https://tomassetti.me/so-much-data-so-many-formats). A tutorial that explains how to create a simple service to convert file between different formats.

This program supports a REST API and also a simple HTML UI to test it. It is the code for a tutorial, so it is not production-ready at all.

As any other .NET Core it can be run by using the command `dotnet run`.

This repository contains the code for the article. In the folder `Examples` there are a few examples files that can be used to test the application.
